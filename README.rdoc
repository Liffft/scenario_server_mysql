Step1: Clone the new scenario server from github
                  git clone https://github.com/gkexplore/scenario_server_mysql.git
Step 2: Make sure you have rvm 2.2.0 version. One can check that by running rvm list command 
                   rvm install 2.2.0
Step 3: Install rails 
                   gem install rails
                    if above command fails due to missing command line tools, then run : xcode-select â€”install  to install command line tools
                    Run the below command again and it would take around 10mins
                   gem install rails 
Step 4: Navigate to cloned scenario server code base and run the following commands
                   To install MySQL server
                   brew install mysql    
                   To install all the required gems for scenario server
                   bundle install

Step 5: Setup mysql

                   To Start MySQL
 
                    mysql.server start
                    
                    To set root password, run
                    mysql_secure_installation
                               Enter current password for root (enter for none): simply press enter
                               Set root password? [Y/n]  - type y
                               New password: auto@123
                               Re-enter new password: auto@123
                               Password updated successfully!
                               Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] - type n
                               Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] - type n
                               Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] - type n
                               Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] - type y
                     To create db 
                               Login into mysql 
                                        mysql -uroot -pauto@123
                               Run below command to create database
                                        create database stubs;
                       Create tables by running the below command from scenario_server folder
                                        bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
Step 6: To start scenario server on port 9090
                  rails s -p 9090
                  Open any browser and access the below URL
                  http://localhost:9090
Now you should be able to see the home screen of scenario server in your machine
